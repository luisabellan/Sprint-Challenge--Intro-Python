# STRETCH GOAL!
#
# Allow the user to input two points, each specified by latitude and longitude.
# These points form the corners of a lat/lon square. Pass these latitude and
# longitude values as parameters to the `cityreader_stretch` function, along
# with the `cities` list that holds all the City instances from the `cityreader`
# function. This function should output all the cities that fall within the
# coordinate square.
#
# Be aware that the user could specify either a lower-left/upper-right pair of
# coordinates, or an upper-left/lower-right pair of coordinates. Hint: normalize
# the input data so that it's always one or the other, then search for cities.
# In the example below, inputting 32, -120 first and then 45, -100 should not
# change the results of what the `cityreader_stretch` function returns.
#
# Example I/O:
#
# Enter lat1,lon1: 45,-100
# Enter lat2,lon2: 32,-120
# Albuquerque: (35.1055,-106.6476)
# Riverside: (33.9382,-117.3949)
# San Diego: (32.8312,-117.1225)
# Los Angeles: (34.114,-118.4068)
# Las Vegas: (36.2288,-115.2603)
# Denver: (39.7621,-104.8759)
# Phoenix: (33.5722,-112.0891)
# Tucson: (32.1558,-110.8777)
# Salt Lake City: (40.7774,-111.9301)
